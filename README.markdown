#generative design with openFrameworks#
* * *

The examples are take from the book "Generative Gestaltung". They have a great website at http://www.generative-gestaltung.de. It's a book that focuses on generative design, that's design made by code. They work with processing. So lots of thanks goes to the authors and the processing community.

This mini projects are made with openFrameworks. I'm looking forward to your comments since I'm learning C++.

To use with openFrameworks 0.7. Get the latest from the git repo: https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks
